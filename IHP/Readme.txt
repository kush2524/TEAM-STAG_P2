In this project we need to first register our name and email and password and further we need to add our number which gets stored in registered database and we can add numbers and mark them as spam and further search by other registered number by name and number.

So this is file all about how to access the end points of this api:-
# At first we need to open to open this in a suitable text editor then install django and djangorestframework using pip
# Further a superuser can be created to see the database through inbuilt ORM of django through admin
# Therefore for each function I have created a python file in the root folder like login,register etc
# First the user need to register by register.py further commments will guide you and need to run python register.py to continue
# Further on login we will get a JWT Token which will be used for all other features i.e. we can mark a number as spam , search by name and number etc
# All python files and functions can be run by using python file_name.py and make sure the server is running i.e. python manage.py runserver
